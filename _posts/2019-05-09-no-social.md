# Why i don't have social network ? 🤔
I used to be a social network user, starting with Twitter back in the day but i never used it so, i moved to Facebook.

Facebook was a key changer for me because i was young and i had a new way of interaction as a shy kid.
In the years Facebook started to be replaced by Instagram and i, like all my friends, switched to the new social.

On Instagram i grew a 2000 followers account just for a challenge but, after reaching the goal, instagram killed my account for no reason.
After this event i re-made my account with the intention of keep it smaller and closed for friends only, this was also the time Instagram added the story on the platform.

With the new change i noticed an increase in use like:
- open the app,
- check all the story
- close it
- after 20 minutes re-open it and check again

All this started to be a real addiction and a waste of time so I decided to stop all this.

This was the first stage of my __"Deputation"__ from _Instagram_
- 🥉 Limit the use with the _Google Digital Wellbeing_ but this didn't helped
- 🥈 Temporary deactivate my account 
- 🥇 Don't login for 3 month 

At this point I started to be more time consciousness and focused on my own lifestyle and hobbies.

The second stage was __"Deputation"__ from data mining !!
- 🥉 Delete Facebook & Twitter account 
- 🥈 More accurate use of the privacy option on every app 
- 🥇 Partial use of [NanoDroid](https://github.com/Nanolx/NanoDroid) NanoDroid 

Now i live without social network with the intention of keep my interaction between people more consistent and not only virtually like socials do !

If you want to see me leave your home and meet me 😁.
My social network will be only this Blog ✌️ keeping my data safe.. _kinda_
