# Why i don't have social network ? 🤔
I used to be a social network user, starting with Twitter back in the day but i never used it so, i moved to Facebook.

Facebook was a key changer for me because i was young and i had a new way of interaction as a shy kid.
In the years Facebook started to be replaced by Instagram and i, like all my friends, switched to the new social.

Over the years Instagram started growing popularity and with that they needed to kill the competitors like snapchat kanging features.. Stories were added.

With the new change i noticed an increase in use:
- open the app,
- check all the story
- close it
- after 20 minutes re-open it and re-do all the process

All this started to be a real addiction and a waste of time so I decided to stop.

This was the first stage of my __"Depuration"__ from _Instagram_
- 🥉 Limit the use with _Google Digital Wellbeing_
- 🥈 Temporary deactivate my account 
- 🥇 Wait Instagram to Auto-Delete my account

At this point I started to be more time consciousness and focused on my own lifestyle and hobbies.

The second stage was __"Depuration"__ from data mining !!
- 🥉 Delete Facebook & Twitter account 
- 🥈 More accurate use of the privacy option on every app 
- 🥇 Partial use of [NanoDroid](https://github.com/Nanolx/NanoDroid)

Now i live without social network with the intention of keep my interaction between people more consistent and not only virtually like socials do !

If you want to see me leave your home and meet me 😁.
My social network will be only this Blog ✌️ keeping my data safe.. _kinda_
