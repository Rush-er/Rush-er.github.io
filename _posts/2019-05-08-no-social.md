# Why i dont have social network ? ðŸ¤”
I used to be a social network user, starting with Twitter back in the day but i never used it so i moved to Facebook.

Facebook was a key changer for me because i was young and i had a new way of interaction, i always be a shy kid.
In the years Facebook started to be replaced by Instagram and i like almost all my friends switched.

On Instagram i growed a 2000 followers account just for a challenge but after reaching the goal instagram killed my account for no reason.
After this event i remade an account with the intention on keep it smaller and add only friends, this was the time Instagram added the story on the platform, with this new change i noticed an increase in use like open the app, check all the story, close, re-open it after 20 minutes and check again.
